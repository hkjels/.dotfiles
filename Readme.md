KISS dotfiles
=============

Dotfiles are the hidden preferences of a unix-based system. These
preferences are merely a backbone for your *nix needs and will need some
additional lovin to fulfill your stack; This is why I've made it possible
to override all of the preferences from local dotfiles, so that you don't
have to put task-specific preferences along with this set of defaults. If
you find any of the defaults really annoying or that something is missing
of the bat, let me know with a pull-request or issue.
