KISS dotfiles
=============

Dotfiles are the hidden preferences of a unix-based system. These
preferences are merely a backbone for your *nix needs and will need some
additional lovin to fulfill your stack; This is why I've made it possible
to override all of the preferences from local dotfiles, so that you don't
have to put task-specific preferences along with this set of defaults. If
you find any of the defaults really annoying or that something is missing
of the bat, let me know with an issue; or even better, a pull request.
