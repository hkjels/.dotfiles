# System preferences

__My personal zshell, vim & git preferences__



## Behavior

I mostly code on OS-X, so these preferences are more optimized for Darwin than
Linux, but I've taken Linux into concideration. The key-bindings in zsh is set
up to somewhat mimic vim, but with addition of a few usefull emacs-like
bindings. There are two dependencies that not yet has found there way into the
installer. __Excuberant ctags__ & __Ntask__. Installing them should be pretty
straight forward though.
